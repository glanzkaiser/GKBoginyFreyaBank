```
Meski waktu datang dan berlalu sampai kau tiada bertahan
Semua takkan mampu mengubahku
Hanyalah kau yang ada di relungku
Hanyalah dirimu mampu membuatku jatuh dan mencinta
Kau bukan hanya sekedar indah
Kau takkan terganti

- From Glanz to Freya (Kahitna - Takkan Terganti song)

A place to put codes that can help us to make decision on which to invest, where to invest. If I have USD 10,000 now and want to make USD 100,000 under 1 year perhaps stocks market is the best place, but which one? Since bonds is safe but the yield is not as high as stocks. 

#### In March 2019, GGRM from IDX / JKSE falls from IDR 90,000 to IDR 17,000 in January 2023. Is IDR 17,000 still overprice? We can see that the highest price is IDR 90,000. When will it hit the bottom? Will it fall again? Check the annual report and calculate the margin of safety, the book value. Use the Jupyter Notebook here to help you if you want it, or just use your intuition.

# How to Setup

1. Create an empty folder name it `GKBoginyFreyaBank`

2. Open terminal at the directory `GKBoginyFreyaBank` and type

```
julia --project="."

julia> using IJulia
julia> notebook()
```

3. Create a new notebook with Python3 kernel (why open it with Julia? Old habit die hard... I still use it for Lasthrim Projection writing anyway. Python that I use is from Conda inside Julia, so Julia is like the root here. While Python is the branch of the tree.)

4. You can copy the notebook I uploaded here. It is for 2023 GKBoginyFreya Bank report. Will be updated.

# Ideas

1. Create C++ codes (scrape, or read form csv then plot) that can give same output like this Jupyter Notebook, but with higher performance.
